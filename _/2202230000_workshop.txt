--------

Open Call Design        -> Juan & Christoph 1 hour call this week
    
Workshop: 
March 2nd 11:00-17:00 + eventually evening team+vorstand update and feedback round 18:00-20:00
March 3rd 10:00-17:00
  
AMRO community participates when they have time:
Christoph & Juan + Onur, Gabriela, Sofia, Giacomo (+ ...?). 
Additional invitation to participation


INITIAL QUESTIONS
* What will we create together? the festival image or the formats where that image ends up being? a vocabulary and workflow for the festival design
* after the workshop: who will pulls the strings of the design and make sure it is applied in the different places (website & prints, but also Social media & video...) and can take decisions about that? Juan, Christoph stays a bit available (?)
* how many people do you think should take place at the first part? amro core people
* when can the process take place? March 2nd & 3rd

IDEA:
extend the sd*w / AMRO workshop idea into opening of the AMRO design project
2 days -> from brainstorm to visual theme
motivation and scope
"better handing over of the design"
basics of print production
worflow: inkscape -> scribus -> to printer
git repos
logos and further materials

Goal -> GRAPHIC VOCABULARY for AMRO22
example: Social bots conference (https://research.radical-openness.org/2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/170210_Site-Banner.png)
generative part
reused as a sampling library for the identity.
Pool of reusable materials
https://freeze.sh/_/2017/socialbots/o/0

AMRO design:
    + Inkscape 
    + small scripts to extract svg files
    + no as book production
    + drawing **

how to export PDF-x conform files for the printer
java-inkscape connections P2W things


**JUAN questions from the train**
What would be the starting point for developing the concept?
Or do we expect the graphical identity to be developed throught the workshop?
What do we expect to be the outcome of the workshop?
the development of a Vocabulary / Language to use in the production of graphics

Workshop Workflow
2 days graphic design software workshop
then, some ppl work on amro's design

- workshop call to AMRO close community
- reading the AMRO text (pre) & bring ideas.
- design thinking (development the vocabulary)
- scribbles
- iterative & fast approach
- No design grid

not festival design team, focus on visual identity;
involving people that are part of AMRO festival team / community.

* design does not end when you send it to the printer
* design team embedded within AMRO production

* subject, inspiration for the visual identity
* all what is done in the workshop is flexible enough to derive the different formats.

* ideas for production
** more integral 
** was generative
** was not a simple offset

also potential open up HOW does the production happens, from costs to production place

post-workshop Design Team
steady design team for the production

IDEEN

- file as container. portable/self-contained website (may be copied, works on the waybackmachine, open/ready for decentralisation), no external dependencies, small file size, clean/structured source, reduction. mixture of ascii brutalism and celebration of the source file. open/readable. writing for humans AND machines.
   - digital brutalism ??
     - http://cramer.pleintekst.nl
     - https://www.forkable.eu
     - https://bleu255.com
   - inline svg/css ??
   - play with possibilities of formats (html)
- concept skin/skeleton (skin/bones): the structure beneath is not hidden accessible sensible (https://vaping-networks.radical-openness.org). relates to file as container.

- design as a language.
  language as a virus (copy me!).
  create vocabulary that can be used and spread.
  https://freeze.sh/_/2017/socialbots
  https://freeze.sh/_/2018/amroui

- two colors

ADDITIONAL: DEBUG OPEN CALL FLYER
ex no *css* flyer, ASCII art (?)

ADDITIONAL AMRO PLATFORM RESTRUCTURE TOPIC

NEUTRAL DESIGN
Generic design but that still people can remember across editions?

- 'freeze' cms pages
- add small 'badge' referring to current edition

Microsites as sensed way of structuring content.

BRAINSTORMING 'CALL FOR PAPERS'

- microsite at https://radical-openness.org/call
  stays there until next years, migrates to https://radical-openness.org/2021/call
  - brutalism with a little twist (?)
    -> text only, colors(?), a html page that is completely 'self-contained', no external dependencies -> can be copied/distributed as one file, works as 'source' and 'display', is portable
  - responsive in a interesting way
  - no problem that it is temporary (may be adjusted after main visual identity, not necessarily)

- ❤️ dsignweek.servus.at

use https://texteditor.com/font-converter for one letter
-> even if the character can not be displayed something
   like this happens D█BUG
- DƎBUG ɓnqǝp dǝbug 𝔡𝔢𝔟𝔲𝔤 d𝔢bug 


TODO:

- setup git repository
 - create call (depending on what it will be)
 - 
- EINPACKEN
 - Print Referenzen (in-between design, Libre Graphics Meeting)
 - Maus
- KLÄREN
 - Rechner vor Ort?
