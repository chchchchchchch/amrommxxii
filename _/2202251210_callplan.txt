BRAINSTORMING 'CALL FOR PAPERS'

- microsite at https://radical-openness.org/call
  stays there until next years, migrates to https://radical-openness.org/2021/call
  - brutalism with a little twist (?)
    -> text only, colors(?), a html page that is completely 'self-contained', no external dependencies -> can be copied/distributed as one file, works as 'source' and 'display', is portable
  - responsive in a interesting way
  - no problem that it is temporary (may be adjusted after main visual identity, not necessarily)

- ❤️ dsignweek.servus.at

use https://texteditor.com/font-converter for one letter
-> even if the character can not be displayed something
   like this happens D█BUG
