 ART  MEETS  RADICAL  OPENNESS 22
</pre><p>
Core of the 2022 annual program of servus.at is <b>AMRO</b>, <b>Art&nbsp;Meets&nbsp;Radical&nbsp;Openness</b>
the biennial festival for art, hacktivism and open cultures, organized since 2008
by servus.at in cooperation with the Linz University of Art, Department of
Time-Based Media.
</p><p>
After the 2020 edition, which was realized as an open source online event for well-known reasons, the 2022 goal is to plan the gathering again as an on-site event, enhanced by a system of hybrid interactions. As usual, the four days of the event will include: a discursive program with keynotes, panels and lectures; a hands-on track with workshops and showcases; a nightline with live coding, sound art and streaming.

<h1>AMRO22: DƎBUG</h1>
<p>The current edition of <b>Art&hairsp;Meets&hairsp;Radical&hairsp;Openness</b> is dedicated to the rituals and the philosophies of debugging, which will be taken in AMRO22 as starting point for a conversation between artists, groups and communities moving together between the fields of culture, politics and technologies.</p>
<p>Software bugs are much more than simple engineering mistakes. Under specific circumstances they can be seen as some of the fundamental features of the current era characterized by ubiquitous technologies. Bugs become visible when a program crashes or the browser window gets stuck; when the developers’ biases come to surface and where the limits of the current infrastructure are reached. Where technology fails, computers appear as what they are: funky, unstable conglomerates of functions, thrown together from different people in different times, at the point that they are barely working, needing constant care and fixes. In communities rooted in Free and Libre Open Source philosophy, developing and maintaining digital services becomes a practice of creating and sharing knowledge. Bugs locate on the area where what is familiar and can therefore  be controlled meets what is not yet apprehended and therefore unstable.</p>
